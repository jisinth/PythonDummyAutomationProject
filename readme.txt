# Traffic Light Simulator

This Python script simulates a basic finite-state machine representing a traffic light system with three states: "red", "green", and "yellow".

## Overview

The `traffic_light.py` script contains a `TrafficLight` class that simulates the behavior of a traffic light. The traffic light cycles through the states of "red", "green", and "yellow" in sequence.

## Usage

To run the traffic light simulator:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/traffic-light-simulator.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

    ```bash
    cd traffic-light-simulator
    ```

3. Run the Python script:

    ```bash
    python traffic_light.py
    ```

The script will display the initial state of the traffic light and simulate state changes according to the traffic light sequence.
